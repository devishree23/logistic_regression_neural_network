    "### Task 1 - Implement Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to classify categorical data. The Sigmoid function or the Hypothesis function to calculate the probabilities of the input data passed to the function. In this implementation of the algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Descent is used to determine model's parameter values that minimises the cost occurred as much as possible to reach the local minima [1]. In Stochastic Gradient Descent, we select one sample from the training cases at random and update weight and bias values as per that case. There are two hyper-parameters learning rate (alpha) and the number of epochs which are passed to the fit function. The size of the steps we take to reach the local minima is decided by the learning rate alpha. "

    "The enhancement implemented below for neural network implementation of Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient model is **Backprop with Momentum Algorithm**. Stochastic Gradient descent has issues traversing ravines which usually occur near the local minimas. Ravines are areas where the surface curves more steeply in one dimension as compared to others. Stochastic gradient tends to oscillate across the slope of ravines and only  slow progressing towards the local optima [5]. Using momentum we use previous changes in the parameter values to infulence the current direction of parameter updates [6] which helps stochastic gradient to accelerate in the right direction."

    "##### Observation:\n",
    "For linearly inseperable data such as Moons dataset, the Logistic Regression model implemented with shallow neural network & backprop with momentum is giving 94% accuracy on validation data and 88% accuracy on test data. The model is not overfitting as accuracy of both validation and tests sets is around 90%. However, when compared to the performance of simple logistic regression model & shallow neural netowork implementation for the same data, we see accuracy has improved with implementation of backprop with momentum to 88% on the test data from 83% of simple implementation & 86% of neural net implementation. The accuracy of the validation set seems to have improved as well from 92% & 90% in simple implementation and neural net implementation respectively to 94% when momentum is implemented.\n",
